# hands-on-machine-learning

In this repo you will find my notes about the book:"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron

Most of the programs and excercises are just copied from the book and the github repo about the book: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3.
